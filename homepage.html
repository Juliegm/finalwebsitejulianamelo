                <h1>Home</h1>
                <p> Welcome! My name is Juliana Melo and this is my portfolio website. I do graphic design, UX design, fashion, photography, etc. Check out my gallery if you want to see my work.<br> I am always willing to take on a new challenge and create something to exceed expectations.</p>
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> An interactive design student in the Greater Boston Area currently studying at Lesley University in Cambridge, MA.<br> Deep passion for print, digital design, fashion, and film, but always willing to explore new fields and apply creativity to a new medium.<br> A quick learner who is always excited to start a new project in order to create something new, while effectively communicating. A team player who builds off of others ideas and<br> always helps push their own and others concepts. Strives to be a leader, inspirer, and learner. While has knowledge, is always open to learning new methods and information.<br> Aims to grow as a designer and become the designer they achieve to be.
                    My experience falls into the Adobe Suite,
                    but I have dabbled in:</p> 
                    <ul>
                    <li>Music</li>
                    <li>Fashion</li>
                    <li>Film Production</li>
                    <li>etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Some of my past projects are:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Logo creation for Third World Manga</li>
                    <li>Go Out Doors - Medford, MA</li>
                    <li>Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility - Medford, MA</li>
                    <li>Murals at Medford High School</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>Why Smokey?</h3>
                <img src="smokey.png" alt="a stuffed animal of a raccoon named smokey" width="35%">
                <p> The name "Smokey" comes from one of the names of my stuffed animals (which is a raccoon).<br> This name holds meaning to me and I have created a lot of work revolving around this stuffed animal.<br> When it came to my brand name, I could not think of a more perfect name to describe my art style: nostalgic, meaningful, and innovative.</p>
